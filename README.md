This project is developed for the Altschool Africa School of Engineering Second Semester Exam. It's a React web application that fetches and displays your GitHub repositories. It features a list of all repositories, detailed views of individual repositories, and it implements an Error Boundary to gracefully handle errors. Custom 404 pages and a well-designed UI are integral parts of this project.

## Features

- Fetch and display a list of your GitHub repositories.
- Implement nested routes to show detailed information for selected repositories.
- Utilize an Error Boundary for error handling.
- Create custom 404 pages for an improved user experience.
- Focus on a visually appealing UI and design.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Routing and nested route handling.
- **Axios**: Making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- **CSS**: Styling and design for the user interface.
- **GitHub API**: Retrieving data about your GitHub repositories.

## Usage
The application displays a list of all your GitHub repositories on the homepage.
Click on a repository to view detailed information.
Test the Error Boundary by intentionally causing an error (e.g., change the API endpoint in the code).
Explore the custom 404 pages by navigating to non-existent routes.
